<h1>All About Dr. O'Grady</h1>

<h2>Before BECA</h2>
<p>I grew up in CT, went to college in Boston and NYC. I majored in Engineering and eventually went into teaching. I have only taught in schools in Harlem and the Bronx.</p>
<h2>During BECA</h2>
<p>This is my 11th year of teaching at BECA. I used to teach math but moved into teaching Coding and Web Design. I also coach the school's robotics team.</p>
  
<h2>After BECA</h2>
<p> I will retire at age 55 after teaching for 27 years. My wife and I will travel and relax and work with rescuing pitbulls.</p>
